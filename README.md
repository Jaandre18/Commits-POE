This Readme file i will explain what i did in my code.
I had no feedback for part2 so i couldnt make any of the changes that was needed to make. I created a new Appliccation that is able to create a recipes
based off of users input. The recipe the user creates can then later be displayd. Each recipe is made out of food groups that i display in a combobox.
That data from the combo box is then used for my pie chart in the application.
Lets explain what the application does.
When the application first starts the page displays 4 Buttons. Each button can take you to a different page.
Click on the Home button that is displayed at the top on the left side of the page.
Fill in the Textboxes in the home page and choose one of the 5 items in the combo box.
Then click create or clear(create,creates a recipe and clear removes all the data you have enterd.
Then go to the display page and choose wich recipe you would like to display. The list is in a combo box, but the list is made out of your recipes so if theres
only one recipe there will just be one option in the combo box.
Then go to the PieChart page. A pie chart will show the percentage of the food groups in your recipe
then you can click the button on the left to add the recipes to the menu/
